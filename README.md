# QueueTracker
Bakkesmod plugin to track Rocket league queue times.

This plugin tracks your queue times, so you finally have proof for those hOuR-lOnG queues!  
It will show you a notification with the time spent in queue after joining a match.

For the plugin to work you have to tick **Enable notificiations** under **Misc** in the BakkesMod settings (F2 by default)!

Currently the plugin only works for the party leader, but party member functionality is already planned!


**Planned features**:
- Add queue-time history per playlist
- Eventually add average queue-times per playlist

**Known Issues**:
- Another player cancelling will re-set the timer.
- Only the party leader can see the queue time


Please report any issues and feedback on Github or mail!
