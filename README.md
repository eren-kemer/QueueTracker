# QueueTracker
Bakkesmod plugin to track Rocket league queue times.

This plugin tracks your queue times, so you finally have proof for those hOuR-lOnG queues!  
It will show you a notification with the time spent in queue after joining a match.

For the plugin to work you have to tick **Enable notificiations** under **Misc** in the BakkesMod settings (F2 by default)!


**Planned features**:
- Add queue-time history per playlist
- Eventually add average queue-times per playlist, region, rank, Time of Day,  etc.

**Known Issues**:
- None?


Please report any issues and feedback on Github, Discord (Kemeren#5968) or mail!
